title: Labyrinth of Crete

The Labyrinth of Crete is the home of the Minotaur, a ferocious beast that roamed its walls. 

The myth starts with King Minos, the son of [[Zeus]] (King of the Gods) and Europa. Minos was proved to be king when [[Poseidon]] (the sea god) sent him a white bull (Cretan Bull). This bull was supposed to be sacrificed but King Minos thought the bull to be too beautiful for death. So, in the bull’s place, King Minos sacrificed another— a much uglier bull. Understandably, the sea god was angered by this and cursed King Minos’ wife, Pasiphae. Her curse was that she fell in love with this Cretan Bull. She kept this a secret until she mated with such an animal and produced a Minotaur named Asterius.

The Minotaur was an anomaly. Half beast, half-human. His diet consisted of the Athenian youngster. The creature was so appalling that Minos ordered his servant to build a structure so elaborate to contain such a monster. It was meant to ensure that the monster could not leave and anyone going in could not escape. This is what we now know as the Labyrinth of Crete. 

This place has terrified heroes of the Greek Mythology world. It became a dwelling place for this Minotaur where he ate human flesh. 

The end came when a young hero named Theseus finally slew the forsaken beast. Theseus accomplished this with a ball of thread which he used to keep track of his footsteps so that he would always find a way out. 

This myth fueled the negative connotation of labyrinths. Even I, until recently didn’t know of the structure’s importance in spirituality and healing. The myth has reached a variety of audiences but if one stops to think of its meaning, it is quite sad. A lonely son, forcefully taken from his parents because of his looks, hidden away in a dark confusing maze only to be slain by some stranger. There are no memories of him, no good experiences in his lifetime. His death is celebrated and in time, forgotten. .
