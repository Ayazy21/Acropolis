title: 4 Virtues of Stoicism
---

The ancient Stoics believed that one should aim for the highest good or *eudaimonia*. This is the idea of a flourishing experience that we should aim for in our lifetime. The Stoics thought that virtue was the best course of action to achieve this highest good. That everything we do must be according to the virtues that we set for ourselves. Once we do this, everything follows including happiness, success, honour, and love. 

The Stoics believed that there were four main virtues: Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, and Justice. 

## Wisdom

The first virtue is Wisdom. In Stoicism, this means practical wisdom because it will help us make logical decisions. This is the ability to make mistakes and learn from them. [[Zeno]], the founder of Stoicism, famously said "Nature gave us one tongue but two ears so that we may listen twice as much as we speak". He meant to observe more. Learn about the world before you take any action. 

It is key to distinguish between wisdom that only contains factual information and the actual wisdom that we need to achieve eudaimonia. We must learn to keep an open mind because Epictetus said that "you cannot learn that which you think you already know". Marcus Aurelius also said "If anyone can show me, and prove to me, that I am wrong in thought or deed, I will gladly change. I seek the truth, which never hurt anybody. It is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance which does harm." 

Wisdom is then therefore taking the teachings of the Stoics and putting them to test in the real world. It is using the right mind to make informed decisions. Without wisdom, we might continue to seek validation for our beliefs and use denial to avoid looking at the realities of our lives. 

The virtue of wisdom coincides with being mindful and grateful. You act with compassion—with logic without your emotions clouding your actions. 


## Courage
The second virtue is Courage. Now, courage is the opposite of cowardice but it does not only apply in physical terms. We often think being courageous is charging into battle with no care. While that may be true, Courage is the ability to act the right way despite our fears, desires, and anxieties. It is having that mental and emotional capacity to stick to your opinions and the teachings of your philosophy. 

In addition, it is the ability to accept things we cannot change. Maybe someone broke your heart, part of courage is facing that and accepting it. It is often easy to declare that we are courageous; it is much harder to practice. Seneca said that "Sometimes even to live is an act of courage." Life is hard and by braving it every day despite the adversities one faces is an act of bravery. 

Fear is unavoidable. We experience the feeling of fear everyday but what separates a Stoic man with a coward? A Stoic man does not entertain these initial reactions. He does not consent to the feelings of the heart. He retains the strength of hist character and keeps his morals despite the gripping fear that he experiences. 

This is courage to face death even if you're not that ready. Though you should be according to the Stoics. It is the courage to risk yourself and put yourself to willing discomfort so that you do not take things for granted. It is the Courage to speak your truth even if others react badly. 


## Temperance
The third virtue is Temperance and in my opinion the most important virtue—it is also the hardest.

> Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy. - *Epictetus*

Temperance refers back to the [[Dichotomy of control]] and how we should always be asking ourselves if something is or is not in our control. This is moderation of the soul in regards to desires and pleasures. Know the **Golden Mean** of things. Be wary of excess and in fact, be willing to be deprived. Once you know discomfrot and discontent, true gratitude will appear. There are only few things that are essential to life. Food, while good, should be consumed moderately and you should never take on more than you can chew. 

Temperance is also keeping ourselves under control. This is acting calm in stressful and problematic  situations. It is the ability to ground yourself so that you will act naturally and not impusively. The calmness. Being the rock in a river stream—unmoving. 

Live simply, virtiously.


## Justice

Justice is tough to define in the modern world and it encompasses greater things than just putting one in jail. For the Stoics, justice is about treating people with kindness, fairness, and respect. It is following our duty to our fellow men and society while acting virtiously. 

This is called Sympatheia or the interconnectedness of all species in the world. Everyone is dependent to each other, whether that relation is big or small. 

> The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrong-doer - *Marcus Aurelius*

Justic is doing what is right no matter the circumstance. It is being honest when everyone else is lying. It is standing your ground even if others disagree. 


# Conclusion
These four virtues should be blueprint of how we live our lives. Life is very unpredictable and the scope of what we have control over is small. Virtue is how we ensure that we are not crippled by the circumstances that life decides to put us through. It is how we turn obstacles in our favour. Always do the right thing no matter what happens by using reason and logics to make choices. 

Virtue is highest form of excellence and the best of expression of human nature. If you have lived life knowing that you acted according to courage, wisdom, temperance, and justice, you can die in peace. Vice is the opposite—it is the way of the beasts. Acting according to virtue reflect our character because it manifests in the way one acts and thinks. In addition, virtue helps foster healthier relationships with others because it is one with no judgement and contains harmony to contribute to the greater good.
