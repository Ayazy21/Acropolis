> In the centre of the web, at the perfect location of cosmic time, the crossroads of the city, lies a palace. It does not look grand. It does not look like anything special; just a red house in Marrakesh. And in it is a courtyard. And inside that is a grey-faced emir, who is smiling, just smiling, sitting on the ground and smiling at a sun that washes over a city that will never die. And he smiles because he knows that utopia is possible, if one only steps, inch by inch, into their own creation.


# Welcome to my Courtyard

A courtyard is an open-air area surrounded by tall walls or tall buildings. It is typically located in the center of a bustling city or town as seen in the ancient cities of Rome and Greece. A place used for relaxation and communication, it can provide solace in troubled times. 
The invitation of natural light and fresh air keeps the area bright and cool for even the hottest of days. This relaxing space is where I have chosen to organize my chaotic [[labyrinth]] of thoughts and ideas. They all exist in harmony and converge here.
