# When You Are Old
by William Butler Yeats

When you are old and grey and full of sleep,  
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,  
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  

How many loved your moments of glad grace,  
And loved your beauty with love false or true,  
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,  
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  

And bending down beside the glowing bars,  
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled  
And paced upon the mountains overhead  
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.


## Analysis 
The rhyme scheme of the first stanza is ABBA. The poem is also written in [[Iambic pentameter]].

An interesting part is that human eyes age the slowest. Often, even old people still hold that twinkle in their eyes. However, Yeats describes that these eyes lost their "soft look" meaning the person is troubled. That they have aged greatly. In addition, the eyes also lost "their shadows deep". That is, there is no depth in those eyes. No emotionâ€”or if there is, it is concealed. 

The narrator also notes that this person is loved true and false. That the love is probably based on their superficial looks, and some are true. Take note of the phrase "pilgrim soul". Historically, pilgrims are those who want to journey, to discover something new. Often, it is a journey to a holy place in search for a connection with the religious system. 

The narrator implies that this person loved the woman for her kindred soul. Her spirituality. This person still continues to love her despite her age or whatever she looked like. 

"Glowing bars" is vague and it can refer to a fireplace where the woman should read the book. However, it can also imply prison, and how she can only see her Love from the outside. That she's in this hell, from her own making or someone else. 

Relating to the first stanza, we can imply that this character has done something that caused them to lose "Love". They regret it but they cannot do anything about it. This explains how there is no more "soft look" or the absence of "shadows deep".

Love, on the other hand, fled. "Crowd of stars" explains heaven. It also makes sense with the "mountains overhead" line. 

Old age has not been kind to this person. The one that truly loved her is gone and now she has to deal with those who only love her for her looks. However, the "Love" still cares for her, from her youth to this old age. He is watching above even though he cannot physically be there.
