title: Letting Go of Resentment

## Bring Up the Past.
Now this goes DIRECTLY against Stoic ideals but sometimes we do have to bring the past. The Stoics advice that we should only focus on the present. Don't worry about the future or rather don't suffer imagined troubles. The past and future are not in our control and therefore does not concern us because of memento mori. Now, this doesn't mean you constantly bring up the past. That becomes a destructive habit. To properly bring up the past, you must have a clear reason and a purpose.

Resentment is something that we create ourselves. It is grown out of aversion and simply ignoring the situation like the Stoics advised is not always the right course of action. Resentment continues. When you keep thinking about it, you create a story—a narrative of how people wronged us and how they will wrong us in the future. This is what Stoicism warned us about: to not bring the past in such a way that it will harm you in the present and will keep on harming you in the future. When you do this, you are effectively putting yourself in a situation you cannot control.

By applying a personal philosophy like Stoicism and implementing practices like meditation, you give yourself the ability to recognize feelings of resentment and their exact sources. This knowledge will eventually help you get over them and find peace.

### Metta - Buddhism
Metta is the practice of loving all beings unconditionally. It roughly translates to "loving kindness". Love eliminates all destructive qualities of human life. 

Letting go of resentment doesn't mean it disappears. No. That would be foolish. Letting go simply means that you are not clinging to these negative feelings that have the power to destroy you…if you let it. To let go completely and forget means that you have lost an opportunity to make yourself better. It's like starting over again with no progress. 

## Ethics
[[4 Virtues of Stoicism]]

Most of us are afraid of confrontation for multitude of reasons. It could be cowardice (something that you should work on) or it could be fear of saying the wrong thing (ties to courage). Most disputes or sources of resentment come from unfair dealing. So instead of saying the right thing and practicing the virtue of justice, we talk ill behind the person's back resolving nothing.

These behaviours are part of the vices and vices lead to unhappiness. So always strive to do the right thing. Use your words even if you might get a bad reaction. Remember, our actions are up to us. How people respond to those actions are NOT up to us.

You did the right thing, that's the only thing that matters. You tried your best and the outcome cannot affect you. You WONT let it.
