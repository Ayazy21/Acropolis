Why do breakups hurts? Falling in love is a very intense experience. That is, at the very beginning, your entire life becomes consumed by that one person. You think of them at all times and your whole universe narrows into a pinpoint. 

What is Love? A series of chemical reactions for the purpose of bonding. That the key word isn't it? Bonding. You BOND with this person. You want to form a connection and when you've established that during the honeymoon phase, it's hard to let go. 

Remember that these chemicals produce a temporary high. Whether we want to admit it or not, these chemicals and our feelings take over the rational mind. Thus, when a breakup occurs, it becomes hard for us to accept what's happened because our rational mind is still taking a break. We are still experiencing a high and then suddenly, it comes crashing back down.

Using Stoicism means using your rational mind. It means changing your wrong perceptions so that you can accept the breakup and everything that comes after it. Now, this won't make the hurt go away—that takes time. BUT it does make it easier to rationalise your feelings to eventually find peace in the separation.

## Wrong Perceptions
1. **I need that person to be happy.**
This attachment can manifest in clingy behaviour and the belief that we NEED this person to be happy. Remember that you do not NEED anyone to be happy. Remember that this person is EXTERNAL. Happiness should come INTERNALLY. Within yourself. Remember that we cannot control external things, we only control our response to them. When we become dependent on people for our happiness, we are essentially selling our soul to them. We LET them dictate our emotions—something that should be in our control. Remember that we do not have much control to start with, and by giving some of that control to others means you have really nothing left. Remember, virtue is the key to happiness. . Love, money, family are **preferred indifference**. That is, they are nice to have, but not necessary to living a good life

2. **I'm entitled to them.** 
We begin to see the other person as a POSSESSION. This emotion goes hand in hand with jealousy. Now what is jealousy? When we are broken up with, we feel that we are wronged. That is, we might think that the reason is unjust. This especially is true for longer relationships when we think they broke some sort of promise to us.

> Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have returned it." Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife deaf? She is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise returned? "But he who took it away is a bad man." What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you to posses, take care of it; but don't view it as your own, just as travellers view a hotel - Epictetus, Enchiridion, 11

3. **I'll Never Get Over That Person.**
Remember that time heals all wounds. Marcus Aurelius used to say, "Some things are rushing into existence, others out of it. Some of what now exists are already gone. Change and flux constantly remake the world, just as the incessant progression of time remakes eternity." Acknowledge that it's there and move on. Endure the detachment phase and it's not an immediate thing to get over. But you will and it will work.

> I knew that I must not oppose your grief during its first transports, lest my very attempts at consolation might irritate it, and add fuel to it: for in diseases, also, there is nothing more hurtful than medicine applied too soon. I waited, therefore, until it exhausted itself by its own violence, and being weakened by time, so that it was able to bear remedies, would allow itself to be handled and touched. - Seneca, Of Consolation: To Helvia, 1

Let the tears flow. Be HUMAN first. AND THEN use Stoicism to apply bandage to the wound.
