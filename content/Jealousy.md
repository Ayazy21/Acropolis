(NOT STOICISM.. yet)

Jealousy and Envy seem to be the same things and often we use the two terms interchangeably. However, it is important to know the distinctions when you are describing your emotions. Now it will be foolish to think that there are no overlaps between the two words.

Jealousy can be rooted in greed. That is, jealousy is rooted in the intention to guard what one possesses or what one hopes to possess. And usually, it is from when one overly desires this thing/someone. [[Why is passion bad?]]. 

When w ^hzk9gae are jealous of other people, we want something. We want to possess something. Now jealousy is not always bad. Jealousy is something intrinsic to human beings. Jealousy is being afraid that they will lose something that they have.

Usually, we use jealousy/jealous to talk about relationships. For example, I go outside with my girlfriend to a party and she talks to this handsome guy. I feel *Jealous*. I am **afraid** that he's going to take her away from me. Now that's not necessarily bad. I can be secure in a relationship but also still feel that **fear**. 

Envy on the other hand means that you want something that they've got. Somebody who is envious wants the same thing that someone else has. In the same situation, I would feel envious that he seems to be better than me in multiple ways. Now this is when it becomes bad because I've started to compare myself with him. It means I'm not secure on MYSELF. It is SADNESS. 

When you're *jealous*, you are resentful about the good fortune of others. You are *envious* because you want that as well. This is when they overlap.

Jealousy is often associated with relationships, mostly romantic. Envy encompasses a wider area. 

Jealousy is rotted in **DESIRE** while Envy is rooted in **RESENTMENT**.

[[Letting Go of Resentment||Resentment]] is THE diabolical sin because it's not enough for me to have what I have. It's not enough for me to be HAPPY with what I already have. This is when you breach Stoicism's words. This is when you start to DESIRE preferred indifference, and you RESENT people who have them. 

This is also when you start becoming dependent on other's people's happiness and success. That is, you are sad when they are happy. When you see them flourishing, it breaks you down.

In the extreme, both are not good. But jealousy is marginally better than one. 

Summary: Jealousy is the fear that you will lose something that you already have. Envy is when you want something else/more.
