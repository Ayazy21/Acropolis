Often, people confuse labyrinths for mazes. Maybe they have heard of the [[Labyrinth of Crete]]. However, labyrinths are traditionally used for personal and spiritual growth. Usually a part of the garden, they sometimes lead to a fountain or a central area for relaxation and peace. 

A labyrinth stimulates the mind and fosters creativity. It is similar to how philosophers would take a hike and walk surrounding themselves with nature. A labyrinth offers the same qualities and forces you to be in your mind because of its minimalistic nature. Often made from tall hedges, the tops are open, and depending on the design, it can be quite spacious. 

The path is purposeful and it is not meant to confuse you. It is a walking meditation and the time it takes to reach the center can be used to reflect on past actions and present events. Be mindful of your senses when entering the labyrinth— remember that it is not a task and if you feel lost, stop and take a deep breath. Find a good walking pace and let your body guide you to the center. For our purpose, let your mind wander; you do not have to explore this labyrinth at one time. Take the ideas, read them, sit on them, and reread them at a later date if you want. There is no rush. 

Open your heart and mind. Be willing to accept these ideas while allowing yourself to disagree with the things you dislike. It is like a conversation with yourself and with me. I respect your opinions just as you should with the mind. This is a place of exchange. Expand on what I have written and give your thoughts. I do not mind. 

Reflect on my writing. Come back to it at a later date and you will find that things have changed. Heraclitus once said, “You cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing on.” Consider how much you’ve grown and how much this labyrinth has grown too. Your thoughts will change and so will mine. The openness to improve and be better is part of the learning journey. 

Come along :)
