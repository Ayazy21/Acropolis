# What is Stoicism - John Sellars


- Logic, ethics, and physics
- Human being: logic is bones, ethics is the flesh, and physics is the soul
- ==all are connected==
- Logic 
	- **Knowledge and Judgements**
	- it is broader than what we mean now
	- What we can know, what we say, the truthfulness of what we say, the logical argument of what we say
	- Rationality is the defining characteristics of humans
	- ==Logical consistency==
		- hypocrisy contradicts that
	- Our judgements are the foundation for all our knowledge
		- information by the senses → to the minds
			- make judgements (accept or decline it)
			- good or bad judgements
		- We also make judgements about value (not just fact)
			- shape our lives
			- pursue the things that we judge are good
				- avoid vices
		- Our emotional lives are the products of the judgements we make
	- "_It's not things that upset us but our judgements about things_" - Epictetus (*Handbook* 5)
	- "_Don't say more to yourself than first impression report. You have been told that someone speaks ill of you. That's what you've been told; you have not been told that you were harmed_" - Marcus Aurelius (*Meditations* 8.49)
	- Pay attention to our judgements
		- **we must slow down and take everything into consideration**
		- cognitive distance between what we experienced and our judgement. 

## Ethics
- **Value and Virtue**
- What's good and what's bad
- Anything that's good—genuinely good, will consistently benefit us
- [[4 Virtues of Stoicism]]
- Being rational, consistent, mentally healthy, not overcome with disruptive emotions, positive character traits
- There is no situation where having a good character will go wrong
- You are not miserable because you have the right frame of mind
- If you psychologically a mess, no amount of fortune or anything can change your state

> When someone complained to Socrates that travelling had done him no good, Socrates replied 'What do you expect, you took yourself with you!' - Seneca



## Physics
- **Nature and Interconnections**
- Organization within nature
- We are all part of something bigger than ourselves

> [!Quote]
> All things are woven together and the common bond is sacred, and scarcely one thing if foreign to another, for they have been arranged together in their places and together make the same cosmos - Marcus Aurelius (Meditations 7.9)
- We all rely in nature
- People who acted in selfishness failed in morals and how the world works 
- Interconnectedness on all things that exist and also the interconnectedness of Stoic philosophy 


**The goal is to live consistently with nature**
