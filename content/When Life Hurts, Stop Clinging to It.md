[[When You Are Old]]


## [[Dichotomy of control]]

> “Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.” - Epictetus, Discourses

Living a good, moral life in accordance to Nature. Do not cling to what's out of our control. This is the world of external pleasures—pleasures that are temporary and just like anything, are a phase of life. We desire what the world has to offer and cling to what stimulates our senses. We become dependent on these externals and we feel despair when we lose them. 


## 1. Stop Clinging to objects, People, and Power
Remember that _real_ love is scarce. Attachment, as we know it, has certain possessive qualities. This is the reason we feel deeply hurt when people walk away from our lives. Love and possession are different. You do not OWN these people, and therefore you should stop clinging to the. The fear of loss and abandonment becomes an obsession. 
[[You Dont Lose People. You Return Them]]


Power leads to hunger. They want more than they have. Power is not in our control. Just like anything, it is ephemeral. It can leave at anytime; people can steal it, leaving you with nothing. 

Think about it like this, if you owned these people, these items, then you are incapable of losing them. However, you _DO_ lose them and that makes a big difference. Enjoy the things while you can but be ready to let go when it is time. 


## 2. Stop Clinging to the Opinions of Others
Why move the world just to get people to like you? Why would you sacrifice yourself for the opinions of others?

> “I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.” - Marcus Aurelius

Their opinions are out of our control. However, the judgements we make about these opinions ARE in our control. Choose wisely or choose nothing at all.  


(From my daily journal)

> [!Quote]
> We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to shape our judgements - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

There are a lot of things that upset us that we know about. However, there is an equal number of things that upset us that we _don't_ know about. The things said behind your back, mistakes that you never noticed, or actions that had consequences but you didn't know. What was your reaction to those? Nothing because you don't know about it. Thus, it didn't affect you. You didn't dwell over those words said behind your back because you didn't hear them in the first place. 

This demonstrates that we _can_ have no opinion about the negative things that happen in our lives. The move now is doing it consciously. Taking all the bad things and seeing them for what they are, an event. It is neither good or bad because _I_ didn't choose for it to be good or bad.

It is irrelevant to me because I have no opinion of it. Better yet, it is nonexistent because I say that it is. It has no power of me because only _I_ have power over _me_.


## 3. Stop Clinging to Outcomes and Ideas
We face so much anxiety thinking about the future and the past.

> "No one can lose either the past or the future - how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Focus on the present—the things you can attend to. Remember, life is short and there is no benefit in dwelling about these things. We cannot control the past and we cannot predict the future. As soon as you accept this, you cannot be harmed by "negative" outcomes or false ideas.
