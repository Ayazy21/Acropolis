# Dichotomy of control

> [!Quote]
> “Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our actions. The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.” - Epictetus, Discourses

The Dichotomy of control is the simplest aspect of Stoicism. In fact, every Stoic will tell you of its idea during the first conversation. Yet, it is the hardest to understand and even harder to master. 

As humans, we tend to believe that we are mere powerless in this giant universe. And that is true. As regular citizens, we cannot even begin to grasp how much power those who have more money or status than we do. Then we progress to a stage where we feel empowered. When we realize that we can do so much more. If not controlled, this stage can lead to ego and irrational actions. 

As a Stoic, you have to maintain that balance. Be aware that most things are out of your control while fully glad that your mind is within your control. Your mind… that sole thing that provides your rational thoughts is one you should cherish. With a strong mind, and consequently, a strong will, you can conquer anything. 

Epictetus tells us that those outside of control cannot harm us. They have no influence over us. When you start thinking this way, you will be unstoppable. Nothing can bother, hinder, or coerce you. When you start taking back control of your brain, and especially your will, there is no limitations on what you can do. That is, you are not bound by the pressures of society and is simply living in true freedom.

Furthermore, by not allowing the emotions and opinions of others, something that is out of your control bother you, there is no harm that can come to you. Their words are stripped of meaning, letters that do not hold any value. 

Start now. Start looking at your life by focusing on the things that are under your control and respond appropriately. If it is not in your control, do not respond at all. You are not obligated to. Just move on with your life and continue harnessing that peace.
