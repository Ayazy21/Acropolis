# You Don't Lose People. You Return Them

Stoics discourage strong attachments. Remember that we are all mortal. By wishing others are immortal, you are wishing for something you cannot control. The fear of loss is just consequences of irrational thinking. 

### Our Attachments of People
Attachment to a person is out of our control. We put the attachment to the hands of fate. You are letting the universe to play with you, be happy or not. When this is you, the desires that dictate you chain you down. You are not free. If you are, the actions would be done in a place of reason. A place of consideration. Loved ones are external things. 

This is a selfish pursuit. This is not for the greater good. Usually, we want it because we cannot handle losing them. We want more time. We tend to make decisions that aren't smart or wise. What stands in our way to these desires, we tend to hate them.

 > It is a general rule—be not deceived—that every living thing is to nothing so devoted as to its own interest. Whatever, then, appears to it to stand in the way of this interest, be it a brother, or father, or child, or loved one, or lover, the being hates, accuses, and curses it. For its nature is to love nothing so much as its own interest; this to it is father and brother and kinsmen and country and God. When, for instance, we think that the gods stand in the way of our attainment of this, we revile even them, cast their statues to the ground, and burn their temples, as Alexander ordered the temples of Asclepius to be burned when his loved one died - Epictetus, Discourses
 
 Think about the vile things that happened in the pursuit of love or attachments of the sort.


### People aren't yours
When you are separated from the people you care for, you feel as if something was taken from you. The notion of loss— you've lost someone. You don't lose people, you return them. They are not yours, they never were.

> Never say about anything, “I have lost it,” but only “I have given it back.” Is your child dead? It has been given back. Is your wife dead? She has been returned.” - Epictetus

External factors are not in our control. They are not ours. Same with what we call our possessions. They are not actually ours, it is just our turn. You can lose these things in the blink of an eye. 

If you cannot understand this, think about slavery. Your loved ones are not your slaves. They do not owe you anything. 

_These things are not in your control. They are not in your control. They are not your possessions._

### Emotional Assent
Romantic love is "passionate". These are volatile emotional experiences. Remember that passion is problematic. 4 Pleasures: Pleasure, Appetite, Distress, and Fear. These are irrational judgements of the situation. 

Being attached to someone, you feel all those four pleasures. When you are with them, you feel pleasure. When they are gone, you feel an appetite to be with them. You fear that they will leave, and when they do, you feel distress. 

There is nothing good with being with others; same as there is nothing bad when they leave you.

> This is what you ought to practise from morning till evening. Begin with the most trifling things, the ones most exposed to injury, like a pot, or a cup, and then advance to a tunic, a paltry dog, a mere horse, a bit of land; thence to yourself, your body, and its members, your children, wife, brothers. Look about on every side and cast these things away from you. Purify your judgements, for fear lest something of what is not your own may be fastened to them, or grown together with them, and may give you pain when it is torn loose. - Epictetus

With the right mindset, discipline, and practice. You can let go of others

### Seneca's Letter
Proto-emotions or feelings that arise automatically and we have no control over them. Stoicism is not about suppression but freeing ourselves from the irrational things in our lives. 

Grief moderately, without limitation. But then stop. Move on. Remember that you are not a Stoic Sage. Everything is in moderation. Take responsibility of your emotions. Heal them in a healthy way. Learn that while they are gone, you shouldn't focus on that. Be glad that you spent time with them in the first place.
